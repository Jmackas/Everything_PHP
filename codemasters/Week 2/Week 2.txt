Notes:
   Are there any reliable beautifiers for PHP?

   How do you get PHP code to compile after the user has input data, and not before?


Lecture:
    There is a difference between a single quote and double quote. 
		A double quote can interpret a variable properly. A single quote cannot. 
		
	A do while loop will always execute at least once (there never really is an instance in which this would need to be used.).

    The point of a while loop is an unknown amount of loops necessary. A for loop is a controlled amount.
