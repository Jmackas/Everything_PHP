Notes:
   Are there any reliable beautifiers for PHP?

   How do you get PHP code to compile after the user has input data, and not before?

   Check out 'atoll'.

   Find a method of highlighting code and automatically commenting it.


Lecture:
    There is a difference between a single quote and double quote. 
		A double quote can interpret a variable properly. A single quote cannot. 
		
	A do while loop will always execute at least once (there never really is an instance in which this would need to be used.).

    The point of a while loop is an unknown amount of loops necessary. A for loop is a controlled amount.

    Remember --> the array index (first item) commences at number [0].

    Numerical array --> using numbers as an index.
    Associative array --> using whatever you want as an index (not number).

    Multidimensional arrays are arrays within arrays.

    A Foreach loop only works for arrays. The traditional loops do work for arrays as well, but typically a Foreach is better practice.

    POST is best practice for recieving user input.

    Bots can't see CSS, therefore you can have a 'display:none;' field that a bot might accidentally fill in. Therefore the PHP knows that a bot entered the form.

    PHP form to email:
        Sanitisation is removing any unlikeable code or special characters added into an input field.

        Email address and other email contents are embedded with how the form is to be recieved.

        Emails cannot be sent on a local host, it needs a mail server.

        It is law to allow people to opt out of automatic emails when signing up. The checkbox can be checked, but it needs to be unselectable.

        The output can be automatically compiled to become a CSV file. CSV file is 'Comma Separated Values'.
