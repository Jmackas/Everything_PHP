Lecture:
    If any use of classes, objects, or methods is invoked, then it is usually object orientaiton.
	
	Object orientation is whenever you model real-world objects.
	
	If inheritence is used as well. 
	
	Doing a very small, simple task? Linear procedure? Probably procedural.
	
	Setters and Getters. Setters assigns data to either private or public access.
	
	The construct function creates a new object.
	
	Moving on to databases
	
	DBMS manages a database.
	
	Anything where data is entered has a database attached. Even content on website.
	
	We haven't made any PHP programs to store content for future reference, therefore no database is needed.
