Lecture:
    If any use of classes, objects, or methods is invoked, then it is usually object orientaiton.
	
	Object orientation is whenever you model real-world objects.
	
	If inheritence is used as well. 
	
	Doing a very small, simple task? Linear procedure? Probably procedural.
	
	Setters and Getters. Setters assigns data to either private or public access.
	
	The construct function creates a new object.
	
	Moving on to databases
	
	DBMS manages a database.
	
	Anything where data is entered has a database attached. Even content on website.
	
	We haven't made any PHP programs to store content for future reference, therefore no database is needed.
	
	Big data = lots of data.
	
	MongoDB is an object orientated database. It is quite difficult to use due to that fact.
	
	SQL --> Structured Query Language.
	
	Syntax between SQL can be different depending on the situation.
	
	What makes DBMS unique, is not the difference in languages, it is what you are allowed to manipulate.
	
	Storing characters:
		Varchar --> you can use whatever you want.
		Char --> has a fixed length.
	
	Int --> whole numbers. You can have different variants to specify the number further, like Tinyint. If the int cannot be defined at that moment, then just use an int.
	
	Float and double. Depending on accuracy either are better to use.
	
	Float allows to 7 digits, while double allows to 15 digits. That being said, a double will use more memory.
